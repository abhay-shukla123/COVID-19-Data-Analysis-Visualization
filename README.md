# COVID-19-Data-Analysis-Visualization
COVID-19 Data Analysis and Visualization using Python, SQL, and Tableau.
### Python • SQL • Tableau • Data Analytics Project

This project analyzes the spread and impact of COVID-19 across Indian states using real dataset records.  
The analysis includes data cleaning, transformation, exploratory analysis, state-wise comparison, and vaccination evaluation.  
An interactive Tableau dashboard is used to visualize case trends, severity, and recovery insights.

##  Tools & Technologies Used
| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn)** | Data Cleaning & EDA |
| **SQL (PostgreSQL)** | Statistical & Comparative Analysis |
| **Tableau** | Interactive Dashboard Visualization |
| **Excel** | Data Source Format |

---

## Exploratory Data Analysis (Python)
- Cleaned and prepared data by removing unnecessary fields.
- Converted date column to appropriate format.
- Created **Active Cases** as:
- Active Cases = Confirmed – (Recovered + Deaths)

- Visualized:
- Top affected states
- Death & recovery trends
- Case progression line charts

---

##  SQL Analysis Highlights
- Total Confirmed, Recovered, and Death figures
- State-wise severity ranking
- Recovery & Mortality rate calculations
- Monthly case trend evaluation
- Vaccination distribution comparison
